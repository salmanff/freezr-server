# freezr-server
freezr makes it very very easy to set up your own server and to run your own apps on it.
It just adds a layer on top of node-js and mongo-db to mke it easy to build javascript apps, or to install apps other people have built.
These apps and all the data from the apps reside on your own freezr server - So at a high leverl, freezr is also suggesting a path to free your personal data from the silos created by traditional web architecture and mobile platforms.
